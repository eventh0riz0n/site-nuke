# Site Nuke – Clear Data for Current Tab

Minimal Chrome/Brave extension for developers.

I built this because I was looking for a simple way to reset site data during development, but most existing tools were overcomplicated, bloated, or locked behind paywalls.  
This is a one-click solution — and maybe it will be useful to someone else as well.

## What it does
With a single click, Site Nuke clears **cookies and site data only for the currently active tab**, then reloads the page.

## Clears (current site only)
- Cookies
- Local Storage
- IndexedDB
- Service Workers
- Cache Storage

## Does NOT
- Clear global browser data
- Affect other tabs or websites
- Collect, store, or transmit any data
- Use analytics or telemetry

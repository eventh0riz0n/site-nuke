# Privacy Policy – Site Nuke

Site Nuke does **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or usage data.

All operations are performed locally within the user’s browser.

The extension:
- does not use analytics

The extension only acts on the currently active website when explicitly triggered by the user.

No data ever leaves the user’s device.
